# Symphony — Failure Model & Security

## Relevant code

- [`src/pyphony/errors.py`](../src/pyphony/errors.py)
- [`src/pyphony/supervisor.py`](../src/pyphony/supervisor.py)

## 1. Failure Model and Recovery Strategy

### 1.1 Failure Classes

1. `Workflow/Config Failures`
   - Missing `WORKFLOW.md`
   - Invalid YAML front matter
   - Unsupported tracker kind or missing tracker credentials/project slug
   - Missing coding-agent executable

2. `Workspace Failures`
   - Workspace directory creation failure
   - Workspace population/synchronization failure (implementation-defined; may come from hooks)
   - Invalid workspace path configuration
   - Hook timeout/failure

3. `Agent Session Failures`
   - Startup handshake failure
   - Turn failed/cancelled
   - Turn timeout
   - User input requested (hard fail)
   - Subprocess exit
   - Stalled session (no activity)

4. `Tracker Failures`
   - API transport errors
   - Non-200 status
   - GraphQL errors
   - malformed payloads

5. `Observability Failures`
   - Snapshot timeout
   - Dashboard render errors
   - Log sink configuration failure

### 1.2 Recovery Behavior

- Dispatch validation failures:
  - Skip new dispatches.
  - Keep service alive.
  - Continue reconciliation where possible.

- Worker failures:
  - Convert to retries with exponential backoff.

- Tracker candidate-fetch failures:
  - Skip this tick.
  - Try again on next tick.

- Reconciliation state-refresh failures:
  - Keep current workers.
  - Retry on next tick.

- Dashboard/log failures:
  - Do not crash the orchestrator.

### 1.3 Partial State Recovery (Restart)

Current design is intentionally in-memory for scheduler state.

After restart:

- No retry timers are restored from prior process memory.
- No running sessions are assumed recoverable.
- Service recovers by:
  - startup terminal workspace cleanup
  - fresh polling of active issues
  - re-dispatching eligible work

### 1.4 Operator Intervention Points

Operators can control behavior by:

- Editing `WORKFLOW.md` (prompt and most runtime settings).
- `WORKFLOW.md` changes should be detected and re-applied automatically without restart.
- Changing issue states in the tracker:
  - terminal state -> running session is stopped and workspace cleaned when reconciled
  - non-active state -> running session is stopped without cleanup
- Restarting the service for process recovery or deployment (not as the normal path for applying
  workflow config changes).

## 2. Security and Operational Safety

### 2.1 Trust Boundary Assumption

Each implementation defines its own trust boundary.

Operational safety requirements:

- Implementations should state clearly whether they are intended for trusted environments, more
  restrictive environments, or both.
- Implementations should state clearly whether they rely on auto-approved actions, operator
  approvals, stricter sandboxing, or some combination of those controls.
- Workspace isolation and path validation are important baseline controls, but they are not a
  substitute for whatever approval and sandbox policy an implementation chooses.

### 2.2 Filesystem Safety Requirements

Mandatory:

- Workspace path must remain under configured workspace root.
- Coding-agent cwd must be the per-issue workspace path for the current run.
- Workspace directory names must use sanitized identifiers.

Recommended additional hardening for ports:

- Run under a dedicated OS user.
- Restrict workspace root permissions.
- Mount workspace root on a dedicated volume if possible.

### 2.3 Secret Handling

- Support `$VAR` indirection in workflow config.
- Do not log API tokens or secret env values.
- Validate presence of secrets without printing them.

### 2.4 Hook Script Safety

Workspace hooks are arbitrary shell scripts from `WORKFLOW.md`.

Implications:

- Hooks are fully trusted configuration.
- Hooks run inside the workspace directory.
- Hook output should be truncated in logs.
- Hook timeouts are required to avoid hanging the orchestrator.

### 2.5 Harness Hardening Guidance

Running Codex agents against repositories, issue trackers, and other inputs that may contain
sensitive data or externally-controlled content can be dangerous. A permissive deployment can lead
to data leaks, destructive mutations, or full machine compromise if the agent is induced to execute
harmful commands or use overly-powerful integrations.

Implementations should explicitly evaluate their own risk profile and harden the execution harness
where appropriate. This specification intentionally does not mandate a single hardening posture, but
ports should not assume that tracker data, repository contents, prompt inputs, or tool arguments are
fully trustworthy just because they originate inside a normal workflow.

Possible hardening measures include:

- Tightening Codex approval and sandbox settings described elsewhere in this specification instead
  of running with a maximally permissive configuration.
- Adding external isolation layers such as OS/container/VM sandboxing, network restrictions, or
  separate credentials beyond the built-in Codex policy controls.
- Filtering which Linear issues, projects, teams, labels, or other tracker sources are eligible for
  dispatch so untrusted or out-of-scope tasks do not automatically reach the agent.
- Narrowing the optional `linear_graphql` tool so it can only read or mutate data inside the
  intended project scope, rather than exposing general workspace-wide tracker access.
- Reducing the set of client-side tools, credentials, filesystem paths, and network destinations
  available to the agent to the minimum needed for the workflow.

The correct controls are deployment-specific, but implementations should document them clearly and
treat harness hardening as part of the core safety model rather than an optional afterthought.
