# Symphony — Issue Tracker Integration

Relevant code:
- [`src/pyphony/tracker.py`](../src/pyphony/tracker.py)
- [`src/pyphony/tracker_queries.py`](../src/pyphony/tracker_queries.py)
- [`src/pyphony/normalization.py`](../src/pyphony/normalization.py)

## 1. Issue Tracker Integration Contract (Linear-Compatible)

### 1.1 Required Operations

An implementation must support these tracker adapter operations:

1. `fetch_candidate_issues()`
   - Return issues in configured active states for a configured project.

2. `fetch_issues_by_states(state_names)`
   - Used for startup terminal cleanup.

3. `fetch_issue_states_by_ids(issue_ids)`
   - Used for active-run reconciliation.

### 1.2 Query Semantics (Linear)

Linear-specific requirements for `tracker.kind == "linear"`:

- `tracker.kind == "linear"`
- GraphQL endpoint (default `https://api.linear.app/graphql`)
- Auth token sent in `Authorization` header
- `tracker.project_slug` maps to Linear project `slugId`
- Candidate issue query filters project using `project: { slugId: { eq: $projectSlug } }`
- Issue-state refresh query uses GraphQL issue IDs with variable type `[ID!]`
- Pagination required for candidate issues
- Page size default: `50`
- Network timeout: `30000 ms`

Important:

- Linear GraphQL schema details can drift. Keep query construction isolated and test the exact query
  fields/types required by this specification.

A non-Linear implementation may change transport details, but the normalized outputs must match the
domain model in Section 4.

### 1.3 Normalization Rules

Candidate issue normalization should produce fields listed in Section 4.1.1.

Additional normalization details:

- `labels` -> lowercase strings
- `blocked_by` -> derived from inverse relations where relation type is `blocks`
- `priority` -> integer only (non-integers become null)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` -> parse ISO-8601 timestamps

### 1.4 Error Handling Contract

Recommended error categories:

- `unsupported_tracker_kind`
- `missing_tracker_api_key`
- `missing_tracker_project_slug`
- `linear_api_request` (transport failures)
- `linear_api_status` (non-200 HTTP)
- `linear_graphql_errors`
- `linear_unknown_payload`
- `linear_missing_end_cursor` (pagination integrity error)

Orchestrator behavior on tracker errors:

- Candidate fetch failure: log and skip dispatch for this tick.
- Running-state refresh failure: log and keep active workers running.
- Startup terminal cleanup failure: log warning and continue startup.

### 1.5 Tracker Writes (Important Boundary)

Symphony does not require first-class tracker write APIs in the orchestrator.

- Ticket mutations (state transitions, comments, PR metadata) are typically handled by the coding
  agent using tools defined by the workflow prompt.
- The service remains a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Workflow-specific success often means "reached the next handoff state" (for example
  `Human Review`) rather than tracker terminal state `Done`.
- If the optional `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented, it is still part of
  the agent toolchain rather than orchestrator business logic.
